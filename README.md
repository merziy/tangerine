# tangerine

## Getting Started
This is a simple web scraper written in Python with a Google Lighthouse wrapper that can quickly test every page on a website for any category.

Currently, it is just set up to test Accessibility. A couple of flags cna be changed to test for another category, such as Performance. At some point, I will change it to ask the terminal to set a category.

Before you start the program, you will need to activate a virtual python environment.

## Activate Python virtual environment

```   
  # Activate the virtual environment, i,e,
  source /Users/alexandermathis/dev/scripts/tangerine/bin/activate

  # Run program
  python3 __main__.py
```
